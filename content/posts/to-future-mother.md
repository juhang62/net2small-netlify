I guess it all starts with an open letter..


To the future mother of our future kid(s):

I am inviting you to make a baby (ok, maybe more than one) and share the reasonability and fun of parenting. We do not necessarily need to start a family in a traditional way. In fact, I favor more a form of co-parenting, about which we shall figure out a reasonable plan. First, I want to assure you that I will be a responsible and loving parent, and also to make sure so will you. For that we will go on “dates”. It is not going to be a romantic date in which each side needs to try hard to impress the other. It is very important that we are frank with each other and show our true self. I am not revealing details about myself in this letter due to privacy concerns. But if you do need more information for the purpose of prescreening, just send me a request. 

In the following, I will describe a few expectations of you (of course they are mutual expectations) and my parenting philosophy, which serve the purpose of prescreening to some extent.

- You are a healthy person (without genetic disorders if your eggs will be used).
- You will be an open-minded and respectful parent. 
- You will reflects on parenting and strive to be a better parent
- Preferably, we will raise our kid(s) in a household where we play father and mother roles. Or at least, we shall maintain a healthy and balanced fatherhood and motherhood for our kid(s).

Thank you very much for reading. If you are interested, please contact me.

Sinerely,
