comment: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nWe would like to introduce to you our service where we can grow the number of your Twitter followers, organically.\r\n\r\nMost people use a follow-unfollow technique where they follow accounts and then unfollow a few days later, hoping a % of them have followed back; or they offer a competition where people have to follow to enter. The big problem with these techniques is that people follow you either out of politeness or because there's an incentive - not because they are interested in your profile. Consequently, this results in poor engagement.\r\n\r\nInstead, we retweet your tweets to our audience of over 3 million people. If they like your profile - they might follow, meaning all your new followers are following because they wish to and not because they had an incentive to do so.\r\n\r\nOur price is $120 per 1000 followers and generally takes around 10-14 days.\r\n\r\nIf this is something you may be interested in, get back in touch.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nNicola"
